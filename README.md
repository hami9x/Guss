Guss - Growing Up Social System
====

A codebase to be used for sites that support social networking and content posting features, runs on Google App Engine.

## Why I started this project?

* Nowadays websites usually need communication and content posting features, so having a good codebase that supports those things would be great
* To practice python and Google App Engine, to make my dream of constructing successfully a big software system real
* And of course, to have fun ^^!

## The goals:

* A good, maintainable and readable codebase, let's make the code as beautiful as possible!
* Runs fast and uses resources effectively
* Stable
* Simple, without much of the interface, installing and designing sugar, this is just a codebase, not a full social networking software
* Supports the following things:
    * Admin control panel, just enough functionalities for managing what necessary
    * Simple blogging system for members
    * Simple forum-like discussion system
    * Member profile, activity stream, private messaging, connection/following... (basic functionalities of a social network)
    * Real-time chat (using App Engine channel API)
